To answer your questions:

Should data be processed synchronously or asynchronously?
In this simple case, synchronous processing should suffice. As the data stream is not expected to be very high-volume, and the processing logic is straightforward, handling the data synchronously should be efficient enough.

If the API needed to support many simultaneous requests, would you be able to handle the load? What would you change?
If the API needed to handle a high load of simultaneous requests, you might consider implementing optimizations such as using a more efficient data structure for the data stream storage (e.g., a circular buffer), and possibly introducing asynchronous processing for handling requests. You could also consider deploying the application on a more robust infrastructure and using load balancing techniques to distribute the load across multiple instances of the application.
